# Course Aims
The past decade has witnessed an explosion in the collection of ‘big data,’ and the sophistication and accessibility of the tools required to analyze those data.
This has spurred government agencies and policy analysts to embrace novel, data-driven approaches to policy creation and evaluation.

This is an introductory course in programming and data analysis for public policy students with no prior coding experience;
 it is the first in Harris's new data science sequence.
It is for anyone who wants to gather, explore, and share raw quantitative data – or work with others who do.
The course has three goals:

1. We will first introduce students to the tools required to write and share code: text editors, the command line, and version control (git).
2. Students will learn to think algorithmically, translating self-contained questions into python programs.
   We will cover the fundamentals of the language including types, control, functions, input/output, and scripts.
   We will touch on debugging and (time-permitting) computability.
3. We will then cover tools and recipes for retrieving, cleaning, visualizing, and analyzing data. 
    * Data science libraries: manipulating data with pandas, plotting with matplotlib and plotly, and running basic statistical and geographical analysis (GIS).  The pandas structures resemble R, and are a useful groundwork for the second course in this series.
    * Relational databases (SQL): selecting and aggregating data from databases.
    * Web scraping and APIs: how to retrieve and use public data from the web.

Ultimately, students should be comfortable using what they've learned in further Harris/Chicago courses in programming and statistics (incl. Policy Lab) -- and in research after leaving Harris.
They should be confident independently finding and exploring new packages for those projects.
They should know enough to productively collaborate on projects with engineers, and understand the potential of such work.

Throughout we’ll emphasize good practices for collaborative code development.
Particularly after the first weeks, we’ll highlight how these skills apply to evaluating and improving policy.


# Books and Resources
Online documentation ('docs') will provide the principal written resources for the class; sources are listed for each week.
For many code projects/'packages' and languages, these sources are literally _the_ standards that define how to use the products -- and unlike books will keep up with the packages as they evolve.
Locating these sources and using them to identify the methods or recipes you need is an important skill in coding.
The most relevant starting sites for us will be for [python 3.5](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/index.html) and [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/).
You will also likely find the question site [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) very useful.


This said, two of the O'Reilly books are very good and happen to be available electronically through the UC library:
  [Think Python](https://catalog.lib.uchicago.edu/vufind/Record/9969856) (Allen Downey) and
  [Python for data analysis](https://catalog.lib.uchicago.edu/vufind/Record/9969841) (Wes McKinney).
Seeing the material multiple times will help -- so please use these resources!!

# Assignments and Grading 
## Weekly assignments (70%)
Assignments will be posted on the class GitHub site at least one week before they are due.
Work will be collected through Chalk and GitHub, so get a student account [here](https://education.github.com/pack).
The first week's assignment will be graded only for completeness, and I will downweight the lowest grade by one half.
Each subsequent assignment will be assessed on: 

* **Correctness (60%)**: Most questions will be evaluated directly on chalk.  In some cases you will have to submit plots, etc. to GitHub.
* **Style and performance (40%)**: A TA will review your code from GitHub. 
  An automatic script will collect work at 1:30am, Wednesday morning.
  _You are responsible for ensuring that your push was successful._
  A per-question rubric out of 4 is as follows:
    0. No apparent effort -- the code is absent or effectively incomplete.
    1. A clear start has been made but the code hangs, crashes or otherwise provides an incomplete answer.
    2. The code is largely complete but gets the wrong answer.  Readily identifiable modifications would result in a working solution.  Commenting is absent or not meaningful.
    3. The answer is correct and the code is readable but uncommented *OR* it is plagued by a single small error but well-commented.
    4. The code is readable and idiomatic (pythonic), and employs the functionality covered in class to succinctly solve the problem.
         The are no bugs -- the solution is correct.
         The commenting is appropriate.  If relevant, it runs "quickly."


Since we may review challenging parts of the homeworks in class on Wednesday,
  late work submitted within one week will count for 80%; notify the TAs to 'pull' it when it is complete.
You must complete (make a concerted effort) on seven of the eight assignments to pass the course.
(This includes pass/fail students.)


## Final Projects (25%) 

Working in pairs, students will ask a simple policy question.
To answer it they will identify at least two disjoint data sources, merge them,
perform a simple but correct statistical analysis
and create a simple (but possibly dynamic) dashboard to illustrate this.
See [final](https://harris-ippp.github.io/final) for full details and due dates.
A proposal including a dataset and a question is due in Week 5 (October 31).

## Participation (5%)

I hope that you will actively use the discussion board.
Asking questions in a public forum means that I and the TAs do not have to answer the same questions repeatedly.
It gives your classmates an opportunity to answer the questions.
Asking good questions is an important and demanding skill.
You will receive credit both for questions that demonstrate effort,
  as well as for answering your classmates.

## Curve

I expect to follow the standard Harris curve: 1/8 A, 1/4 A-, 1/4 B+, 1/4 B, 1/8 B-.
If I feel that it better maps the effort of the class, I may instead adopt
  1/6 A, 1/3 A-, 1/6 B+, 1/6 B, 1/6 B-,
  which is more generous almost everywhere.

## Plagiarism policy.

Writing code is substantially different from writing essays:
it is standard practice to find individual functions or google things that don't work, and copy a line or two from the manual or stack overflow.
I encourage you to discuss general strategies for solving problems with your classmates and friends.
Questions and answers on the discussion board will naturally include code.
However -- you should never ask to see another's solutions, and you absolutely should not copy code from your classmates.
No one but you should type your code.
If you find more than a single line/method, you should attribute the source in your comments.

# Where to Work / How to Compute

Part of the overhead to doing computation is getting the software running.
Students will therefore install the software required for the class on their personal laptops.
This will enable them to straightforwardly continue using the skills that they develop, when the quarter is over.

You will need the command line ([cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) on PCs, Terminal on Mac),
python (I will only support the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution), and a text editor ([Atom](https://atom.io/)).
Installation instructions are posted for [macs](https://harris-ippp.github.io/mac_install) and
[PCs](https://harris-ippp.github.io/windows_install).  (If you're using Linux, you're probably not in this class.)
This installation is the entire first week's homework, but it will also be used in the first week's classes!
At a minimum, you should have Atom (and cygwin, for Windows) installed *before the first class.*
We will hold multiple lab sessions in the first week, when will provide direct computing support.
You **must** get the help you need at that point -- we won't provide this support for the entire quarter.

**Bring your laptop to every class** -- short demos will be an important part of the lectures.

# Weekly Schedule

## Week 1: Welcome to the Course -- and to the Command line!

The first class is the only one for which there will be no live demos.
The homework assignment requires that your installation is complete.
There will be an additional TA session in the first week (on Tuesday) to assist with this.
**It is absolutely required that your installation work.
You MUST come to one of the three TA sessions to get any help or,
  if none of the three are possible,
  contact me or the TAs.**
I understand that computer mishaps happen,
  but one-on-one installation tech support after the first week is at the discretion of the TAs.
